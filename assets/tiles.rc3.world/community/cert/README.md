# From cert.ccc.de with love
This are our over 250 individual tiles/sprites for the rc3 workadventure.

* Composed tilesets are located in imgs/tilesheets
* Sets ending with _set are deprecated, please don't use them anymore.


## check_imgs.py
We strongly recommend using this script as pre-commit script.
It checks all image dimensions and compiles a tilesheet for every directory if wanted.

They are safe to use, no existing tiles will me replaced or moved inside the sheet.
